# Changelog

## 2026-01-08

- Fixed keyboard teleoperation mesh penetration caused by spring-like gripper behavior: releasing the button instantly opened the gripper, producing excessively large instantaneous displacement (effectively infinite velocity).

## 2025-12-29

- Added bilingual documentation for the `XTrainerVR` WebXR teleoperation workflow in `README.md` and `README.zh.md`.
- Created this changelog to track future documentation and feature updates.
- Updated the headset support tables in both READMEs to mark Quest 3 / PICO 4 as available (✅) while keeping Vision Pro in progress (🔄).
