Python module serving as a project/extension template.

Because the isaaclab environment needs to be decoupled 
to execute the xtrainer calibration script,

Note! If this file is commented out, 
you should execute "import leisaac.tasks" at the beginning of the main file; 
otherwise, the task environment will not be found correctly.
